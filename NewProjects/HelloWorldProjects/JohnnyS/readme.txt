We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I (do I)
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
gonna give you up
gonna let you down
gonna run around and desert you
gonna make you cry
gonna say goodbye
gonna tell a lie and hurt you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
gonna give you up
gonna let you down
gonna run around and desert you
gonna make you cry
gonna say goodbye
gonna tell a lie and hurt you
gonna give you up
gonna let you down
gonna run around and desert you
gonna make you cry
gonna say goodbye
gonna tell a lie and hurt you
